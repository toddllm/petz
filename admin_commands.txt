## Setting Up Admin Access:

1. The first player to join an empty server automatically gets all privileges
2. OR join with the name specified in minetest.conf (currently "admin")
3. Grant privileges to trusted players: /grant <playername> all

## From Server Console:

If you need to grant privileges from the Linux terminal:
sudo -u Debian-minetest minetestserver --terminal --world /var/games/minetest-server/.minetest/worlds/world

Then use commands without the '/' prefix:
grant <playername> all
