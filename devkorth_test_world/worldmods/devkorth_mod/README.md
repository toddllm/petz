### The Ultimate Truth

Devkorth is described as being "more powerful than code" - he can supposedly:
- Open and close all doors
- Protect himself absolutely
- Change any aspect of the game
- Affect other games outside Minetest
- Grant or revoke any ability

According to the lore, "All the characters are Dev's" - suggesting he has ultimate ownership over all existence in the game world.

The only way to survive an encounter with Devkorth is to show respect and avoid hostility. Those who attack him face devastating consequences, while those who approach peacefully may receive divine gifts and cosmic knowledge.
