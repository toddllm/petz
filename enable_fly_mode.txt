HOW TO ENABLE FLY MODE IN LUANTI/MINETEST
=========================================

Even with fly privileges, you need to enable fly mode:

1. Press K to toggle fly mode on/off
   - You'll see "Fly mode enabled" or "Fly mode disabled" message

2. If K doesn't work, try:
   - Press / to open command console
   - Type: set fly
   - Or in chat (T): /set fly

3. Flying controls:
   - Space: Fly up
   - Shift: Fly down
   - Double-tap Space: Toggle between walking and flying
   - Hold Shift while flying to descend faster

4. Other useful modes:
   - Press J to toggle fast mode (move faster)
   - Press H to toggle noclip mode (walk through walls)

Note: Some servers or games may have different key bindings. 
Check Settings > Change Keys if the default keys don't work.
